### AWIP Shop (React)

This is part of a comparison project, discovering the pros and cons between React and Vue, whilst building a shop.

## Why compare React and Vue?

I'll hold my hand up now and declare myself a Vue fan.
However, I'm not brave enough to say Vue is better than React.
I haven't used React as much as Vue.
I haven't even used all of Vue's features, nevermind have a solid comprehension of how React compares to Vue.
The best way to compare, I thought, is to build the same application in both, trying to explore as many features of both as I can.

## Why a shop?

Having worked with a large, multi-brand e-commerce business recently, I realised there are a huge number of features that have been added over the years.
However, did these features get added because they were right for the every brand?
Were they part of a brand that came into the e-commerce business' stable?
Did any of them evolve organically?
Possibly a shop needs every feature ever divised for every shop; who knows?
